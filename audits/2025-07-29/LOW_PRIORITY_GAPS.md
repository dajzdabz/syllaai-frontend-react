**Value**: Help users choose appropriate courses

### Export Capabilities (LOW)
**Enhancement**: Advanced export formats (PDF reports, CSV data)  
**Current**: Basic Google Calendar export

## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Architecture

### Microservices Architecture (LOW)
**Enhancement**: Split monolithic backend into services  
**Consideration**: May be overkill for current scale

**Potential Services**:
- Authentication service
- Syllabus parsing service  
- Calendar export service
- Grade calculation service (future)

### GraphQL API (LOW)
**Enhancement**: GraphQL alongside REST API  
**Value**: More efficient data fetching for complex queries

### Real-time Features (LOW)
**Enhancement**: WebSocket support for real-time updates  
**Use Cases**: Live collaboration, instant notifications
