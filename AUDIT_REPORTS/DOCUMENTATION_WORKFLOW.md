## 🔄 Maintenance Workflow

### **📝 Before Starting Work**

1. **Read Master Tracker**
   ```bash
   # Always start here
   cat MASTER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
   ```

2. **Check Current Priority**
   - Review "Next Priority Actions" section
   - Identify which task to work on
   - Update status to "In Progress"

3. **Review Related Documentation**
   - Check linked specifications in REFERENCE/
   - Read previous session logs if continuing work
   - Consult security tracker for security-related tasks

### **🛠️ During Work Session**

1. **Update Status in Real-Time**
   ```markdown
   # Change in MASTER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
   | SEC-04 | Course Discovery Authorization | 🔄 **In Progress** | ...
   ```

2. **Document Decisions & Issues**
   - Keep notes of important discoveries
   - Record architectural decisions made
   - Note any blockers encountered

3. **Track File Changes**
   - List files modified during session
   - Note database migrations or config changes
   - Record deployment steps taken

### **✅ After Completing Work**

1. **Update Master Tracker**
   ```markdown
   # Mark as completed
   | SEC-04 | Course Discovery Authorization | ✅ **Done** | High | Claude | [Link] | 2025-07-28 |
   ```

2. **Create Session Log** (for significant work)
   ```bash
   # Create new file
   SESSION_LOGS/2025-07-28_brief_description.md
   ```

3. **Link Session in Master Tracker**
   ```markdown
   # Add session link to Last Session column
   [2025-07-28](./SESSION_LOGS/2025-07-28_description.md)
   ```

4. **Update Next Priority Actions**
   - Remove completed tasks
   - Add any new tasks discovered
   - Reorder priorities if needed

## 📊 Session Log Template

Create new session logs using this template:

```markdown
# [Icon] [Brief Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Session Duration**: ~X hours  
**Priority**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [Context]  
**Status**: [✅ RESOLVED / 🔄 IN PROGRESS / ❌ BLOCKED]  

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
[What issue were you solving?]

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis  
[What investigation did you do?]

## 💡 Solution Implemented
[What did you actually do?]

## ✅ Resolution Verification
[How did you test/verify the fix?]

## 📊 Impact Assessment
[What was the impact on users/system?]

## 🔮 Lessons Learned
[What would you do differently next time?]

## 🚀 Next Actions  
[What follow-up work is needed?]
```

## 🎯 Task Management Guidelines

### **Status Definitions**
- **📋 Pending**: Not started, ready to begin
- **🔄 In Progress**: Currently being worked on (limit to 1-2 tasks)
- **⏸️ Blocked**: Waiting on external dependency
- **👀 In Review**: Completed, awaiting validation
- **✅ Done**: Completed and verified

### **Priority Guidelines**
- **High**: Critical for core functionality or security
- **Medium**: Important for user experience
- **Low**: Nice-to-have or optimization

### **Adding New Tasks**
1. **Identify Need**: During work, new requirements discovered
2. **Create Entry**: Add row to appropriate section of master tracker
3. **Link Documentation**: Create spec file in REFERENCE/ if needed
4. **Set Priority**: Based on impact and urgency
5. **Update Next Actions**: Add to appropriate timeline section

---

## 🔍 Context Preservation Rules

### **Critical Information to Preserve**
- ✅ **Decisions Made**: Why approach X was chosen over Y
- ✅ **Problems Encountered**: What didn't work and why  
- ✅ **Files Changed**: Exact paths and nature of changes
- ✅ **Dependencies**: What needs to be done before/after
- ✅ **Testing Approach**: How changes were verified
- ✅ **Deployment Steps**: How changes reached production

### **Session Log Triggers**
Create a session log when:
- ✅ Fixing a production issue
- ✅ Implementing a major feature  
- ✅ Making architectural changes
- ✅ Solving complex debugging problems
- ✅ Completing security fixes
- ✅ Any work session > 1 hour

### **What NOT to Log**
- ❌ Trivial typo fixes
- ❌ Minor documentation updates
- ❌ Routine maintenance tasks
- ❌ Work that didn't result in changes

## 🚀 Quick Reference Commands

### **Starting a New Session**
```bash
# 1. Check current status
head -20 MASTER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

# 2. Find your next task
grep -A 5 "Next Priority Actions" MASTER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

# 3. Review related docs
ls REFERENCE/ | grep [relevant_topic]
```

### **Ending a Session**
```bash
# 1. Update master tracker status
# 2. Create session log if needed
# 3. Commit documentation changes
git add AUDIT_REPORTS/
git commit -m "docs: update progress tracking"
```

---

## 🔄 Review & Maintenance

### **Weekly Review**
- Update progress percentages in master tracker
- Archive completed session logs older than 30 days
- Review and update priority rankings
- Clean up any obsolete documentation

### **Monthly Review**  
- Analyze session logs for patterns/improvements
- Update workflow based on lessons learned
- Archive old reference documents if superseded
- Backup entire AUDIT_REPORTS folder

## 🧑‍💻 Integration with Development

### **Git Integration**
```bash
# Always include doc updates with code changes
git add backend/app/routers/courses.py AUDIT_REPORTS/MASTER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
git commit -m "fix: update courses auth + track progress"
```

### **Deployment Integration**
- Update master tracker before deploying
- Create session log for production fixes
- Link deployment status in tracker
- Record rollback procedures if needed
