# View Course Events Functionality Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The view course events functionality has significant technical issues including raw SQL usage to bypass ORM problems, complex authorization logic, and retry prevention that may mask legitimate errors. While functional, the implementation represents multiple architectural compromises and technical debt.

## Critical Issues (High Priority)

### 1. **Raw SQL to Bypass ORM Issues**
- **Problem**: Uses raw SQL instead of ORM to avoid enum conversion problems (lines 1014-1044 in courses.py)
- **Issue**: Bypassing SQLAlchemy completely to work around enum handling
- **Impact**: Loss of type safety, potential SQL injection risk, maintenance complexity
- **Root Cause**: Underlying enum handling problems not properly fixed

### 2. **Complex Authorization Matrix**
- **Problem**: Different authorization logic for admin, professor, and student roles (lines 974-1010)
- **Issue**: Complex nested conditionals with different query patterns per role
- **Impact**: Difficult to maintain, potential authorization bugs
- **Code**: Three separate authorization paths with different error handling

### 3. **Retry Prevention for 500 Errors**
- **Problem**: API service explicitly disables retries for `/events` endpoints returning 500 errors (lines 156-159 in api.ts)
- **Issue**: Masking server errors as acceptable behavior
- **Impact**: Users may not see events due to hidden server errors
- **Root Cause**: Server errors treated as normal instead of fixing underlying issues

### 4. **Manual Data Transformation**
- **Problem**: Manual conversion from database rows to JSON format (lines 1026-1044)
- **Issue**: Lost benefits of ORM including automatic serialization
- **Impact**: Potential data inconsistencies, maintenance overhead

### 5. **Student Data Exposure Risk**
- **Problem**: Course events may contain sensitive information visible to all enrolled students
- **Issue**: No granular access controls on event visibility
- **Impact**: Privacy violations, inappropriate information disclosure
- **Evidence**: All enrolled students see all course events regardless of content sensitivity

### 6. **Event Injection Through Course Ownership**
- **Problem**: Course owners can create events with arbitrary content visible to all students
- **Issue**: No content moderation or validation on event descriptions
- **Impact**: Potential for inappropriate content, spam, or misinformation
- **Security Risk**: Event descriptions could contain malicious links or content

## High Priority Issues

### 7. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Different error responses for same failure conditions
- **Issue**: Some roles get "not found", others get "access denied" for same situation
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience, debugging difficulties

### 6. **Performance Issues with Authorization**
- **Problem**: Separate database queries for each role type
- **Issue**: Could be optimized with single query using joins
- **Impact**: Poor performance, increased database load

### 7. **Graceful Degradation for Personal Courses**
- **Problem**: Empty personal courses return empty arrays instead of proper empty state
- **Issue**: No distinction between "no events" and "failed to load events"
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, unclear error states

### 8. **React Query Retry Configuration**
- **Problem**: Blanket retry prevention that may hide legitimate network errors
- **Issue**: No retry for any failed events request
- **Impact**: Transient network issues not handled gracefully

## Medium Priority Issues

### 9. **String Conversion for UUIDs**
- **Problem**: Manual UUID to string conversion in raw SQL (line 1024)
- **Issue**: Type system bypassed, potential conversion errors
- **Impact**: Potential data corruption or query failures

### 10. **Hardcoded SQL Field Selection**
- **Problem**: Manual field enumeration in SELECT statement
- **Issue**: Fragile if database schema changes
- **Impact**: Maintenance burden, potential runtime errors

### 11. **Inconsistent Date Serialization**
- **Problem**: Manual ISO format conversion for timestamps
- **Issue**: Different date handling than ORM automatic serialization
- **Impact**: Potential timezone or format inconsistencies

### 12. **Missing Pagination Implementation**
- **Problem**: Query supports LIMIT/OFFSET but no frontend pagination
- **Issue**: Large course event lists may cause performance issues
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with many events

## Low Priority Issues

### 13. **Error Message Inconsistency**
- **Problem**: Different error messages for similar authorization failures
- **Issue**: "Course not found" vs "you are not enrolled" vs "access denied"
- **Impact**: User confusion about actual problem

### 14. **Manual JSON Construction**
- **Problem**: Building event dictionaries manually instead of using models
- **Issue**: Prone to typos and field mismatches
- **Impact**: Potential runtime errors

### 15. **Comments in Production Code**
- **Problem**: TODO comments and debug notes in production (line 1015)
- **Issue**: Indicates incomplete or temporary solutions
- **Impact**: Technical debt accumulation

## Architecture Violations

### 16. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Violation**: Single endpoint handles authorization, data access, and serialization
- **Impact**: Changes to one aspect affect others

### 17. **Open/Closed Principle**
- **Violation**: Adding new user roles requires modifying existing authorization logic
- **Impact**: Risk of breaking existing functionality

### 18. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
- **Violation**: High-level business logic depends on low-level SQL implementation
- **Impact**: Cannot swap database or ORM without extensive changes

## Security Concerns

### 19. **Authorization Logic Complexity**
- **Problem**: Complex role-based access control with multiple code paths
- **Issue**: Higher chance of authorization bypass bugs
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized access to course events

### 20. **Raw SQL Parameter Injection**
- **Problem**: While using parameterized queries, pattern is risky
- **Issue**: Future developers might not maintain safe practices
- **Impact**: Potential SQL injection if not carefully maintained

### 21. **Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
- **Problem**: Different error messages reveal system behavior
- **Issue**: Users can probe system to understand course enrollment status
- **Impact**: Information leakage

## Performance Issues

### 22. **Database Query Inefficiency**
- **Problem**: Separate authorization queries before main data query
- **Issue**: Multiple round trips to database for single request
- **Impact**: Increased latency and database load
