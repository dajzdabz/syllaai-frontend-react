# SyllabAI Cleanup Archive - July 16, 2025

This archive contains files that were cleaned up from the SyllabAI project structure to improve organization and reduce clutter.

## Contents Archived:

### build_artifacts/ (528KB)
- `dist/` - React build output directory
- Auto-generated files that can be recreated with `npm run build`

### backup_files/ (8KB)  
- `003_add_default_schools.py.backup`
- `004_add_missing_school_columns.py.backup`
- Alembic migration backup files (mentioned in CLAUDE.md as temporary)

### misc_files/ (80KB)
- Various scattered `.md` documentation files from main directory
- `fix_missing_school_id.sql` - Loose SQL file
- Organizational documentation that was misplaced

### python_cache/ (56KB)
- `__pycache__/` directories from backend
- Compiled Python bytecode files (`.pyc`)
- Auto-generated cache files

### node_modules/ (Empty - permission issue)
- Node.js dependencies (183MB) - could not move due to permissions
- These should be removed manually and regenerated with `npm install`

## Recovery Instructions:

If you need any of these files back:

1. **node_modules**: Run `npm install` in frontend-react directory
2. **dist**: Run `npm run build` in frontend-react directory  
3. **Python cache**: Will be auto-regenerated when Python modules are imported
4. **Backup files**: Can be restored to `backend/alembic/versions/` if needed
5. **Documentation**: Move from `misc_files/` back to appropriate locations

## Project Structure Improvements:

- ✅ Fixed corrupted backend `.gitignore`
- ✅ Removed Python cache files  
- ✅ Archived build artifacts
- ✅ Organized scattered documentation
- ✅ Archived temporary backup files

Total space cleaned: ~672KB archived (183MB node_modules still needs manual removal)
