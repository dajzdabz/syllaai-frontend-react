# SyllabAI Security Audit Implementation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of critical security fixes identified in the production readiness audit.

## ‚úÖ High-Priority Security Issues RESOLVED

### 1. Refresh Token Encryption
- **Issue**: Google refresh tokens stored in plain text
- **Solution**: Implemented AES-256 encryption using Fernet cipher
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created `app/utils/crypto.py` with `TokenEncryption` class
  - Updated `User` model with encrypted property accessors
  - Uses PBKDF2 key derivation from SECRET_KEY
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/models/user.py` - Added encryption properties
  - `app/utils/crypto.py` - New encryption utilities
  - `requirements.txt` - Added cryptography dependency

### 2. OpenAI API Key Security
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ALREADY SECURE
- **Verification**: API key properly stored in environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Location**: `app/config.py` line 20

### 3. Input Validation Implementation
- **Issue**: No input validation on API endpoints
- **Solution**: Comprehensive validation framework
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `app/schemas/validation.py` with secure input types
  - `SecureString` class prevents SQL injection and XSS
  - `SecureEmailStr` with RFC compliance
  - Updated all schemas to use secure validation
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/schemas/validation.py` - New validation framework
  - `app/schemas/user.py` - Updated with secure validation
  - `app/schemas/course.py` - Updated with secure validation
  - `app/middleware/security.py` - Authorization middleware

### 4. Database Model Consolidation
- **Issue**: Redundant Event/CourseEvent and Enrollment/StudentCourseLink models
- **Solution**: Merged into unified models
- **Implementation**:
  - Consolidated `CourseEvent` as primary event model
  - Enhanced `StudentCourseLink` as primary enrollment model
  - Added proper enums for categories and sources
  - Maintained backward compatibility with aliases
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/models/course_event.py` - Unified event model
  - `app/models/student_course_link.py` - Enhanced enrollment model
  - `app/models/course.py` - Updated relationships

### 5. Cascading Deletes
- **Issue**: No cascading deletes leading to orphaned data
- **Solution**: Added CASCADE constraints to all relationships
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated all foreign key relationships with `ondelete="CASCADE"`
  - Added `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` to SQLAlchemy relationships
- **Migration**: `005_security_and_model_consolidation.py`

### 6. Non-Nullable Fields with Defaults
- **Issue**: Course model had nullable fields without defaults
- **Solution**: Made critical fields non-nullable with appropriate defaults
- **Implementation**:
  - `school_id`: Required field with default=1
  - `crn`: Required field with default="TBD"
  - `semester`: Required field with default="2025SP"

### 7. OAuth2 Flow Consistency
- **Issue**: Inconsistent OAuth2 implementation
- **Solution**: Refactored auth flow with robust role detection
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `app/services/role_service.py` for intelligent role detection
  - Enhanced email domain patterns for academic institutions
  - Added validation for role assignment requests
  - Improved security in auth endpoints
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/routers/auth.py` - Refactored OAuth flow
  - `app/services/role_service.py` - New role management service

### 8. Role Management System
- **Issue**: Naive role management based on email domains
- **Solution**: Robust role detection and validation system
- **Implementation**:
  - Comprehensive domain pattern matching
  - Support for international academic domains (.ac.uk, .edu.au, etc.)
  - Role validation and upgrade request system
  - Permission-based access control
- **Features**:
  - Auto-detects professor vs student from email
  - Validates role assignment requests
  - Supports role upgrade workflows
  - Admin role protection

### 9. Authorization Middleware
- **Issue**: Missing authorization checks on endpoints
- **Solution**: Comprehensive authorization middleware
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `app/middleware/security.py` with role-based access control
  - Course ownership validation
  - Enrollment-based access control
  - Action-based permission system
- **Functions**:
  - `require_professor()` - Professor-only endpoints
  - `require_student_or_professor()` - General authenticated access
  - `require_course_owner()` - Course modification rights
  - `require_course_access()` - Course viewing rights

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256 via Fernet (cryptographically secure)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations
- **Salt**: Fixed application salt for deterministic key generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for decryption failures

### Input Validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Pattern-based detection and blocking
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML tag and JavaScript detection
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Directory traversal attempt blocking
- **File Upload Security**: Content type and filename validation
- **Length Limits**: Appropriate field length restrictions

### Authorization Framework
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier role system (Admin/Professor/Student)
- **Resource-Based Authorization**: Course ownership and enrollment checks
- **Permission System**: Granular action-based permissions
- **Cascade Protection**: Prevent unauthorized data access through relationships

### Role Management
- **Smart Detection**: Advanced email pattern matching for academic institutions
- **Validation System**: Role assignment request validation
- **Upgrade Workflows**: Secure role elevation processes
- **Admin Protection**: Restricted admin role assignment

## üìã Database Migration

Created migration `005_security_and_model_consolidation.py` that:
- ‚úÖ Adds new enum types for categories and sources
- ‚úÖ Updates foreign key constraints with CASCADE
- ‚úÖ Makes Course fields non-nullable with defaults
- ‚úÖ Enhances StudentCourseLink with tracking fields
- ‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/jdabl/SyllabAI/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Verify Security**:
   - Test refresh token encryption/decryption
   - Verify input validation on all endpoints
   - Test role-based access control
   - Confirm cascading deletes work properly

## üîç Security Testing Checklist

### Input Validation Testing
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts on all string inputs
- [ ] Test XSS payload injection in text fields
- [ ] Test directory traversal in file uploads
- [ ] Verify email validation edge cases
- [ ] Test oversized input handling

### Authorization Testing
- [ ] Verify students cannot access professor-only endpoints
- [ ] Test course ownership validation
- [ ] Verify enrollment-based access control
- [ ] Test admin privilege escalation protection
- [ ] Verify cascading delete authorization

### Encryption Testing
- [ ] Verify refresh tokens are encrypted at rest
- [ ] Test decryption of existing tokens
- [ ] Verify encryption key rotation capability
- [ ] Test graceful handling of decryption failures

## üìö Security Documentation

### For Developers
- All new endpoints must use appropriate authorization decorators
- Input validation schemas are mandatory for all user inputs
- Role checks should use the RoleDetectionService
- Sensitive data must be encrypted before database storage

### For Operations
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Regular review of role assignments
- Audit trail for permission changes
- Backup encryption keys securely

## üéØ Next Steps (Medium Priority)

1. **Service Layer Implementation**: Separate business logic from presentation
2. **Frontend Security**: Move to modern framework with built-in security
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format
4. **Logging**: Security event logging and monitoring
5. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting implementation
6. **Session Security**: Enhanced session management
